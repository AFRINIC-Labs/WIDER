This is where all the frontend happens. 
If you want to edit general content like the header, footer, home page, 
about page then you will have to edit the files in this directory.

NOTE: That these pages extend and overwrite the changes of the wazimap library. Python allows you to overwrite sections, instead of whole files. If there are sections you want to overwrite but can't find them in these files, you might have to go to the wazimap source files
in the virtual python enviroment to find out how to overwrite them. 

The css for these pages are under wazimap_ww/static/css/.

Click through to the Profiles sub-directory to edit the chart pages.
