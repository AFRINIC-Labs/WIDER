note: in this example I am not using a virtualenv, because I am comvinced that it's impossible to install gdal on it.

install postgres

install pip

pip django install

django startproject wazimap_ww

cd wazimap_ww

delete everything inside

git clone https://github.com/AFRINIC-Labs/WIDER

sudo apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin

pip requirements.txt

edit: settings.py, change the directory of the logs, REMEBER TO CHANGE THEM BACK!!!

delete all the files that end in .pyc if there are any

python manage.py migrate

let louw know if you have a database error

python manage.py runserver
